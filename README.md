# MiamiCrimeDataAnalysis
Goal
The goal is to carry out a potentially simple but proper analysis on the spatiotemporal dataset, and develop a report on your findings that shall be submitted in a reproducible way.

# Report requirements

Introduction
data
methods

Length: text should not exceed 5 pages of A4 (about 2500 words), excluding code sections
The introduction shall contain a motivation, a research question and a hypothesis that will be tested
Analysis requirements
The analysis shall show some exploratory data analysis (simple plots and maps) but go beyond that and test the hypothesis formulated in the introduction. The spatial and/or spatiotemporal aspects of the data shall be considered when interpreting the hypothesis tests.

# Reproducibility
Reproducibility can be guaranteed by submitting a notebook-style document, like a .Rmd or quarto document, or else a report along with an R or Python script that reproduced the analysis. If datasets used are not imported from R packages then they need to be submitted as well.
the notebook sources, or R script(s) the document rendered in its final presentation form, if notebook style showing both code (code should not be hidden) and figures (pdf or html)
